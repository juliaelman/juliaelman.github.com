I've been meaning for a while now to get this app up and running on Github. It's a pretty simple, light weight app whose primary purpose is to serve as a base skeletal structure for a showcase of the users work. It can be used for writing samples, photos or almost anything else you'd like to showcase!

I plan on building this out more and making the templates more robust. There are a few ideas that I have, but suggestions are welcome!
