It's been a long time in the making, but it's finally here. My website re-design! (insert trumpets blaring here)

After about 2 design rounds, I finally decided to go with simple and clean. Over my many years of design I find that is always the way to go.

Another part of this whole get-up that I am completely proud of, is the fact that I built out a few things completely by scratch:

- a portfolio app for my work pages
- building out my own slice, running on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid), Apache, Django, PostgreSQL

So, I'll pat myself on the back about that, but I am still not 100% happy. This Summer I plan on making my site my laboratory (muah, ha, ha) to play around with and HAVE FUN! Because that's what being in this business is all about, isn't it? Learning new things and building cool sh*t.
