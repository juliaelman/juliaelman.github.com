title: Joining the iron yard
---

This past March I had the privilege to be a mentor for [Pearl Hacks](http://pearlhacks.com/), a hackathon for college and high-school aged women at UNC-CH. It was an inspiring event for me and I really enjoyed seeing all of the amazing things that the students came up with! I had the opportunity to teach some of the attendees about [Django](http://djangoproject.com) and the fundamentals of starting their first Django project. It was very nostalgic and it also made me realize one thing: I love teaching.

Today I am thrilled to announce that I'll be joining [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) as their Front End Engineering Instructor at the new campus in Durham. I'll be joining my talented colleague [Clinton Dreisbach](https://twitter.com/cndreisbach), who also helped me at the [2013 Teen Tech Camp](http://juliaelman.com/blog/2013/08/20/teen-tech-camp-recap/), to build an amazing school for our local community. (FYI: We'll also be doing some free coding classes for kids too!)

Our first round of classes starts this June and I am amazed at the talented applicants that have already applied. It's going to be an adventure for us all and am looking forward to showing off all of the talent the Triangle has to offer!

PS. We're still accepting applications for June! Learn more and apply for the class here: [http://theironyard.com/academy/front-end-engineering/](http://theironyard.com/academy/front-end-engineering/).
