title: Virtual volunteering
---

This past weekend I had the unique opportunity to speak at a first time conference [PyTennessee 2014](http://www.pytennessee.org/) in Nashville, TN. I gave a talk called "To the Moon and Back: Taking the Leap in Solving Big Problems." It's a talk I had given at [SecondConf 2013](http://secondconf.com/2013/) and am very happy to have been given the opportunity to bring this talk to the Python community.

During my talk, I touched on the past, present and future of solving big problems as technologists. I ran through a few scenarios outlined in the [MIT Technology Review](http://www.technologyreview.com/) article titled: [Why We Can't Solve Big Problems](http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/429690/why-we-cant-solve-big-problems/), by Jason Pontin. Pontin points out a few conclusions about why we have failed to solve big problems and ends the article with this statement:

{% raw %}
<blockquote cite="http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/429690/why-we-cant-solve-big-problems/">
	<p>
		It’s not true that we can’t solve big problems through technology; we can. We must. But all these elements must be present: political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem, our institutions must support its solution, it must really be a technological problem, and we must understand it.
	</p>
	<strong>

</blockquote>
{% endraw %}

This statement presents an answer to the question of our ability to solve big problems. So, how can we help as technologists? Where can we even start?

I mentioned a few virtual volunteering opportunities where we, as professional technologists, can help contribute our talents. I've started a short list below and also made it completely open source, [forkable on Github](https://github.com/juliaelman/juliaelman.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2014-02-24-virtual-volunteering.md). I encourage you to submit a pull request, or even shoot me a message on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/juliaelman) or email me at [juliaelman@gmail.com](mailto:juliaelman@gmail.com) for events and/or opportunities where professional technologists can give back. It's an exciting time and I am looking forward to hearing about all of the opportunities we have to help contribute and solve big problems.

### Click (One-day event)
[http://www.nashvillecode.org/](http://www.nashvillecode.org/)

A free event for teachers and programmers. I learned about this while at PyTennessee 2014 and am thrilled to hear about this opportunity to connect professional educators and developers.

### Code for America (Organization)
[codeforamerica.org](http://codeforamerica.org)

Code for America brings together local governments and technologists to make better cities for everyone.

### Code Montage (Organization, Events)
[codemontage.com](http://codemontage.com)

Code Montage helps empower coders to improve their impact on the world. On January 18, 2014, they held a "Coder Day of Service" in which 1300 volunteer coding hours helped amplify 50 projects.

### Make Good (Virtual volunteering)
[jenmyers.github.io/makegood](http://jenmyers.github.io/makegood)

Virtual volunteering opportunities for web designers and developers.

### Random Hacks of Kindness (Organization, Events)
