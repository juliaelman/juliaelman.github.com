As mentioned at the end of [my last writing](/blog/2015/03/06/pressing-play/), I spent my time off speaking with several colleagues and employers about working with them. Today I am proud to finally announce that I have joined the team at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/).

### What is 18F?

18F is a digital service agency based within the [United States General Service Administration](http://www.gsa.gov/). Our focus is user centered design, lean startup methods and open source. We work with agencies within the U.S. government to help solve problems and create a significant impact on the way we interact with government services.

In other words, it's a dream job.

I get to work with some AMAZINGLY talented people who are like minded on making an impact inside of government. Everyone I have met this week has the same instinctual drive for the kind of work we are doing. It's thrilling to be surrounded by [this kind of energy](https://esq.io/blog/posts/joining-18f/) and the feeling of a [shared sense of purpose](https://alexgaynor.net/2015/feb/03/software-of-the-people-by-the-people-for-the-people/).

And on that note, I've got to run... because we've got a lot of work to do!
